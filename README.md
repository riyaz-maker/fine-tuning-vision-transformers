At step 90, where the validation loss is at its highest and accuracy is at its lowest, the model is likely experiencing overfitting. This is indicated by a low training loss coupled with high validation loss and reduced accuracy.
The final steps (110 and 120) show an optimal balance with low validation loss and high accuracy, suggesting that the model has achieved a good generalization capability by the end of this fine-tuning phase. This is an encouraging sign that the fine-tuning process has successfully enhanced the model's performance on the validation dataset.
